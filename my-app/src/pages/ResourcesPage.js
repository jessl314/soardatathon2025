          For anyone struggling with financial stability and therefore their wellness, our great city of LA does have some resources to help people have their basic needs met. With a simple search, people can find nearby shelters, food banks, and other resources to get support from ‚Äì or donate to, if one has the sufficient means. Beyond just getting basic needs met, Fault Lines hopes that greater systemic changes can be proposed and put into place to break people out of these cycles of poverty. For these reasons, we have attached some helpful links for both people in need and those wanting to help.

          We at Fault Lines are so happy to have you reading this and offering us your time and attention ‚Äì we hope that with every view this page gets, more people can become aware of the issues surrounding them and their communities. LA is the city where our hearts lie, and our passion and effort was devoted to this project so that we can help bring up the people of our communities. Systemic poverty is an all encompassing problem, and every factor of life can and is deteriorated when living in unequal conditions. Because of this, we know that it is important to share information about the epidemic of poverty, health, and crime, and we are proud to present our project as a facilitator to conversations to promote change.
